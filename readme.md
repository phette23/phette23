Hi :wave: I'm the Systems Librarian at [California College of the Arts Libraries](https://libraries.cca.edu). As such, I maintain and develop a number of library and learning technologies, including a Koha ILS, Summon discovery layer, LibGuides, openEQUELLA repository, Panopto video platform, Moodle LMS, Wagtail website, and several smaller applications. I publish much of my code under [CCA's GitHub organization](https://github.com/cca).

I enjoy using and contributing to open source software. Some of my favorite work involves data munging, data visualization, metadata wrangling, full-stack web development, and integrating disparate systems using APIs. My favorite programming languages are Python and JavaScript.

I'm an active member of the [Code4Lib](https://github.com/code4lib) community and tend to volunteer at every annual conference. If you see me, say hi! Meeting new folks is always welcome.
